# 🚦🚔 CitiFine: Traffic Violation Management System 🛣️

CitiFine is a full-stack web application designed to provide users with an intuitive platform for managing and viewing traffic violations. The application offers a smooth experience, allowing users to easily access their violation records through a user-friendly interface, making it simple to check any traffic infractions.
  
In many locations, especially in remote, rural, or developing areas, traffic management systems are often outdated or not well-established. These regions struggle with tracking and managing traffic violations efficiently, resulting in delays and inefficiencies in law enforcement. Another common issue in many existing systems is the lack of an integrated online payment option. Without this feature, users often need to pay in person or manually process transfers, leading to inconvenience and potential delays in resolving violations.
